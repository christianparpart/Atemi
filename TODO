IciclePlus Todo List:
--------------------

* localization: for at least 'en' and 'de'
* UI: auto-adjust cooldown icon list if they exceed the width of its parent frame (nameplate)
	* make this optional by configuration
* configuration: add profile-support

LONGTERM TODO TODO:
-------------------

* modularize cooldown instances into its own "Cooldown"-class and provide different representation classes:
	* PlatedCooldown -- attached to the players nameplate
	* GladifiedCooldown -- attached to the player frame of Gladius
	* BarCooldown -- attached to a seperate bar-list frame of cooldowns.
