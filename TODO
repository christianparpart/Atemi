IciclePlus Todo List:
--------------------

* localization: for at least 'en' and 'de'
* UI: auto-adjust cooldown icon list if they exceed the width of its parent frame (nameplate)
	* make this optional by configuration
* configuration: add profile-support
* UI: alert on spell use (e.g. coldsnap)
	- announceUse = bool (default: false)
* UI: alert on cooldown expirey (e.g. when Counterspell is (about to be) ready again)
	- announceReady = bool (default: true)
	- announceReadyShift = SECONDS (number of secs ahead of spell availability, default: 3)

announce text:
	- "$SPELL_ICON $SPELL_NAME used by $ENEMY"
	- "$SPELL_ICON $SPELL_NAME @ $ENEMY is ready in $TIME s"
	- show icon, name, or icon and name.
	- announcing shall be configurable per spell independantly

LONGTERM TODO TODO:
-------------------

* modularize cooldown instances into its own "Cooldown"-class and provide different representation classes:
	* PlatedCooldown -- attached to the players nameplate
	* GladifiedCooldown -- attached to the player frame of Gladius
	* BarCooldown -- attached to a seperate bar-list frame of cooldowns.
